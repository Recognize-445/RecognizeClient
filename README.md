## Overview

Google Glass application which allows user to take photo of someone and predict their name. Requires a [Recognize server](https://github.com/kbalouse/Recognize) to be running in order to work properly.

## Motivation

This is for the final project in EECS 445 for the Fall 2015 semester at the University of Michigan.

## Installation

This requires you to install the Android 4.4.2 (API 19) SDK and Glass Development Kit Preview prior to compilation. You can open this project in Android Studio or your IDE of choice. After setting up the [Recognize server](https://github.com/kbalouse/Recognize), modify the IP address and port in RecognizeRequestor.java. In the future this will be moved to a config file.
