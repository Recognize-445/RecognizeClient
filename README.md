## Overview

Google Glass application which allows user to take photo of someone and predict their name. Requires a [Recognize server](https://github.com/kbalouse/Recognize) to be running in order to work properly.

## Motivation

This is for the final project in EECS 445 for the Fall 2015 semester at the University of Michigan.

## Installation

After setting up the [Recognize server](https://github.com/kbalouse/Recognize), modify the IP address and port in RecognizeRequestor.java. In the future this will be moved to a config file.
